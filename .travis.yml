# Builds the docker-machine-driver-hetzner and releases it, if the build is a tag

# To make it work, create and encrypt an OAuth token for the Github API as follows:
# (1) Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and create a new private token
#     with scope "public_repo".
# (2) Convert the token into a Travis secret as described at
#     https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/:
#     * (assuming you are on a shell with the current working directory being
#       inside a local working copy of your Github project)
#     * gem install travis
#     * travis encypt <the token created in step (1)>
#     * add the secure: "<encrypted token>" to the travis.yml file as a key
#       below the api_key
