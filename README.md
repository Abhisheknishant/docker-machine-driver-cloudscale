> This library adds the support for creating [Docker machines](https://github.com/docker/machine) hosted on the [cloudscale.ch Cloud](https://www.cloudcale.ch).

Based on the Work of:
* https://github.com/JonasProgrammer/docker-machine-driver-hetzner
* https://github.com/cloudscale-ch/machine



## Building from source

Use an up-to-date version of [Go](https://golang.org/dl) and [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)

To use the driver, you can download the sources and build it locally:

```shell
# Get sources and build the binary at ~/go/bin/docker-machine-driver-cloudscale
$ go get github.com/splattner/docker-machine-driver-cloudscale

# Make the binary accessible to docker-machine
$ export GOPATH=$(go env GOPATH)
$ export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
$ export PATH="$PATH:$GOBIN"
$ cd $GOPATH/src/splattner/docker-machine-driver-cloudscale
$ dep ensure
$ go build -o docker-machine-driver-cloudscale
$ cp docker-machine-driver-cloudscale /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-cloudscale
```

## Development

Fork this repository, yielding `github.com/<yourAccount>/docker-machine-driver-cloudscale`.

```shell
# Get the sources of your fork and build it locally
$ go get github.com/<yourAccount>/docker-machine-driver-cloudscale

# * This integrates your fork into the $GOPATH (typically pointing at ~/go)
# * Your sources are at $GOPATH/src/github.com/<yourAccount>/docker-machine-driver-cloudscale
# * That folder is a local Git repository. You can pull, commit and push from there.
# * The binary will typically be at $GOPATH/bin/docker-machine-driver-cloudscale
# * In the source directory $GOPATH/src/github.com/<yourAccount>/docker-machine-driver-cloudscale
#   you may use go get to re-build the binary.
# * Note: when you build the driver from different repositories, e.g. from your fork
#   as well as github.com/splattner/docker-machine-driver-cloudscale,
#   the binary files generated by these builds are all called the same
#   and will hence override each other.

# Make the binary accessible to docker-machine
$ export GOPATH=$(go env GOPATH)
$ export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
$ export PATH="$PATH:$GOBIN"

# Make docker-machine output help including cloudscale-specific options
$ docker-machine create --driver cloudscale
```
